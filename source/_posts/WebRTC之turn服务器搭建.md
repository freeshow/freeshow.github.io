### coturn服务器介绍：

> 1.This project evolved from rfc5766-turn-server project (https://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/). There are many new advanced TURN specs which are going far beyond the original RFC 5766 document. This project takes the code of rfc5766-turn-server as the starter, and adds new advanced features to it.
> 
> 2.**Free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server**
The TURN Server is a VoIP media traffic NAT traversal server and gateway. It can be used as a general-purpose network traffic TURN server and gateway, too.

>On-line management interface (over telnet or over HTTPS) for the TURN server is available.

>The implementation also includes some extra experimental features.
